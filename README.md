Intro To Cyber Security

Cyber Security is a huge topic, and it can be challenging to know where to start. This path will give you a hands-on introduction to different areas within cyber, including:


• Careers in Cyber Security

• Offensive Security; hacking your first application

• Defensive Security; defending against a live cyber attack

• Exploring security topics in the industry



What is offensive security (Red Team)

Offensive Security

hacking in to computers sytems using exploiting software and bug and loophole to gain unauthorized access to them

To beat a hacker, you need to behave like a hacker, finding vulnerabilities and recommending patches before a cybercriminal does, as you did in this room!

On the flip side, there is also defensive security, which is the process of protecting an organization's network and computer systems by analyzing and securing any potential digital threats


In a defensive cyber role, you could be investigating infected computers or devices to understand how it was hacked, tracking down cybercriminals, or monitoring infrastructure for a malicious activity.




What careers are there?
The cyber careers room goes into more depth about the different careers in cyber. However, here is a short description of a few offensive security roles:
• Penetration Tester - Responsible for testing technology products for finding exploitable security vulnerabilities.
• Red Teamer - Plays the role of an adversary, attacking an organization and providing feedback from an enemy's perspective.
• Security Engineer - Design, monitor, and maintain security controls, networks, and systems to help prevent cyberattacks.

How can I start learning?
People often wonder how others become hackers (security consultants) or defenders (security analysts fighting cybercrime), and the answer is simple. Break it down, learn an area of cyber security you're interested in, and regularly practice using hands-on exercises. Build a habit of learning a little bit and you'll acquire the knowledge to get your first job in the industry

	Offensive security focus on breaking systems owned with exploiting ,abusing insecure steps and taking advantage of  broken access control policies, among other things. Red teams and penetration testers specialize in offensive security.
	
	
Defensive security is somewhat the opposite of offensive security, as it is concerned with two main tasks:

1. Preventing intrusions from occurring
2. Detecting intrusions when they occur and responding properly


	Some of the tasks that are related to defensive security include:
• User cyber security awareness: Training users about cyber security helps protect against various attacks that target their systems.
• Documenting and managing assets: We need to know the types of systems and devices that we have to manage and protect properly.
• Updating and patching systems: Ensuring that computers, servers, and network devices are correctly updated and patched against any known vulnerability (weakness).
• Setting up preventative security devices: firewall and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) are critical components of preventative security. Firewalls control what network traffic can go inside and what can leave the system or network. IPS blocks any network traffic that matches present rules and attack signatures.
• Setting up logging and monitoring devices: Without proper logging and monitoring of the network, it won't be possible to detect malicious activities and intrusions. If a new unauthorized device appears on our network, we should be able to know.

There is much more to defensive security, and the list above only covers a few common topics.

• Security Operations Center (SOC)
• Threat Intelligence
• Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)
• Malware Analysis


Learn about the different careers in cyber security.

Cyber security careers are becoming more in demand and offer high salaries. There are many different jobs within the security industry, from offensive pentesting (hacking machines and reporting on vulnerabilities) to defensive security (defending against and investigating cyberattacks).
Why get a career in cyber:
• High Pay - jobs in security have high starting salaries
• Exciting - work can include legally hacking systems or defending against cyber attacks
• Be in demand - there are over 3.5 million unfilled cyber positions


Security Analyst

Responsible for maintaining the security of an organisation's data
Security analysts are integral to constructing security measures across organisations to protect the company from attacks. Analysts explore and evaluate company networks to uncover actionable data and recommendations for engineers to develop preventative measures. This job role requires working with various stakeholders to gain an understanding of security requirements and the security landscape.

Responsibilities
• Working with various stakeholders to analyse the cyber security throughout the company
• Compile ongoing reports about the safety of networks, documenting security issues and measures taken in response
• Develop security plans, incorporating research on new attack tools and trends, and measures needed across teams to maintain data security.

Security Engineer

Design, monitor and maintain security controls, networks, and systems to help prevent cyberattacks
Security engineers develop and implement security solutions using threats and vulnerability data - often sourced from members of the security workforce. Security engineers work across circumventing a breadth of attacks, including web application attacks, network threats, and evolving trends and tactics. The ultimate goal is to retain and adopt security measures to mitigate the risk of attack and data loss.

Responsibilities
• Testing and screening security measures across software
• Monitor networks and reports to update systems and mitigate vulnerabilities
• Identify and implement systems needed for optimal security

Incident Responder

Incident Response

Identifies and mitigates attacks whilst an attackers operations are still unfolding
Incident responders respond productively and efficiently to security breaches. Responsibilities include creating plans, policies, and protocols for organisations to enact during and following incidents. This is often a highly pressurised position with assessments and responses required in real-time, as attacks are unfolding. Incident response metrics include MTTD, MTTA, and MTTR - the meantime to detect, acknowledge, and recover (from attacks.) The aim is to achieve a swift and effective response, retain financial standing and avoid negative breach implications. Ultimately, incident responders protect the company's data, reputation, and financial standing from cyber attacks.

Responsibilities
• Developing and adopting a thorough, actionable incident response plan
• Maintaining strong security best practices and supporting incident response measures
• Post-incident reporting and preparation for future attacks, considering learnings and adaptations to take from incidents

Digitsl Forensics Examiner

Responsible for using digital forensics to investigate incidents and crimes
If you like to play detective, this might be the perfect job. If you are working as part of a law-enforcement department, you would be focused on collecting and analysing evidence to help solve crimes: charging the guilty and exonerating the innocent. On the other hand, if your work falls under defending a company's network, you will be using your forensic skills to analyse incidents, such as policy violations.

Responsibilities
• Collect digital evidence while observing legal procedures
• Analyse digital evidence to find answers related to the case
• Document your findings and report on the case

Malware Analyst

Analyses all types of malware to learn more about how they work and what they do
A malware analyst's work involves analysing suspicious programs, discovering what they do and writing reports about their findings. A malware analyst is sometimes called a reverse-engineer as their core task revolves around converting compiled programs from machine language to readable code, usually in a low-level language. This work requires the malware analyst to have a strong programming background, especially in low-level languages such as assembly language and C language. The ultimate goal is to learn about all the activities that a malicious program carries out, find out how to detect it and report it.

Responsibilities
• Carry out static analysis of malicious programs, which entails reverse-engineering
• Conduct dynamic analysis of malware samples by observing their activities in a controlled environment
• Document and report all the findings

Penetartion Tester

Responsible for testing technology products for security loopholes
You may see penetration testing referred to as pentesting and ethical hacking. A penetration tester's job role is to test the security of the systems and software within a company - this is achieved through attempts to uncover flaws and vulnerabilities through systemised hacking. Penetration testers exploit these vulnerabilities to evaluate the risk in each instance. The company can then take these insights to rectify issues to prevent a real-world cyberattack.

Responsibilities
• Conduct tests on computer systems, networks, and web-based applications
• Perform security assessments, audits, and analyse policies
• Evaluate and report on insights, recommending actions for attack prevention

Red Teamer

Plays the role of an adversary, attacking an organisation and providing feedback from an enemies perspective
Red teamers share similarities to penetration testers, with a more targeted job role. Penetration testers look to uncover many vulnerabilities across systems to keep cyber-defence in good standing, whilst red teamers are enacted to test the company's detection and response capabilities. This job role requires imitating cyber criminals' actions, emulating malicious attacks, retaining access, and avoiding detection. Red team assessments can run for up to a month, typically by a team external to the company. They are often best suited to organisations with mature security programs in place.

Responsibilities
• Emulate the role of a threat actor to uncover exploitable vulnerabilities, maintain access and avoid detection
• Assess organisations' security controls, threat intelligence, and incident response procedures
• Evaluate and report on insights, with actionable data for companies to avoid real-world instances
